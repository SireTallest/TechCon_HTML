            <h2>Our History</h2>
            <p>TechCon was founded in 2015 by a group of passionate software engineers and tech enthusiasts who envisioned a platform where innovators could share ideas and inspire the next generation of technology leaders. What began as a small gathering of 200 attendees in a modest conference hall has grown into one of Africa's premier technology conferences, attracting over 5,000 participants annually from across the globe.

                Over the years, TechCon has evolved from focusing solely on software development to encompassing emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, cybersecurity, and cloud computing. The conference has hosted groundbreaking product launches, facilitated partnerships worth millions of dollars, and provided a launchpad for countless startups that have gone on to transform industries.

                From its humble beginnings to becoming a catalyst for technological innovation across the continent, TechCon continues to embody the spirit of collaboration, learning, and progress that defined its creation nearly a decade ago.
